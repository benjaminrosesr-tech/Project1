# Portfolio
This website serves as a portfolio to showcase the abilities and scope of talent offered by Rose Digital Imaging. This site will showcase the full range of abilities and skills I bring to Logos Brand Design, Photography, and Advertising.  As I expand my abilities in full-stack development, I will also showcase those projects and abilities there as well. As this is a work portfolio, I will always be expanding and making changes as time goes on

## Developer
Benjamin Rose

## Technology Used
1. Html
2. CSS
3. Java
4. Bootstrap

## User Stories
1. I want this website to be responsive across different screen sizes with a theme switcher. The navigation should also be easy to follow and simple to navigate.
2. There should be a page for logos, a page for photography, and a page for advertisements. Each should showcase the work in a different format; for example, the advertisement page should include an image to view the advertisement in full format.
3. I want the contact page to include a simple form for people to fill out in the advent that they would like some work done. make it a little informal yet require phone number, name, and email. Also make it so it sends me an email of the form upon completion. Then redirect the user to a success page and a button returning them to the home page.

## Future Plans
In the future, I would love to get the redirect after submitting the form to go back to my website, which I thought I had made work.  It would seem I need to look a little deeper into Java to make that portion work. I will also be adding modal pop-ups to the photography page to where it displays a card format with picture on top and a little blurb about the picture below.
